# typescript-promise
## Simple promise implementation in TypeScript

Provides just basic API and for clarity it's free from any micro and macro optimizations.

It's also proof of concept of how straightforward promise implementation can be with its design centered around `done` method.

Can safely be used in projects where code size is important, it's definitely one of the smallest promise implementations.

Total lib size is under 800 bytes gzipped.

### Things not covered in this implementation:

##### Rejection in case of circular resolution

Circular resolution of promises is in most cases result of a bug. Promise/A+ demands to throw `TypeError` when such action occurs. It's not in effect (at least currently) in ECMAScript 6 version.
This implementation to stay away from additional complexity does not handle that as well. Resolving promise with itself leaves promise _resolved_ but in forever locked _unsettled_ state.

##### Support for foreign promises (thenables)

Promise/A+ requires support for foreign (not coming from same implementation) promise objects, it's also specified behavior for ECMAScript 6 promises. Foreign promises assimilation is tricky and to make sure things won't break (by really _unexpected_ type of implementation) involves numerous security steps.
This logic is not important to understand how promises work, so to keep things simple, this library recognizes just own promises.
